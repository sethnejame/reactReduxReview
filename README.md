# React Redux

This is a boilerplate for a React/Redux demo & review.  This is a manual install - rather than run `npx create-react-app myapp` we have instead configured the following:

-Babel, for transpiling JS/JSX
-Webpack for bundling our JS & CSS
-ESLint for linting/coding quality
-Webpack web server, to serve up our app
-Loading changes on save w/ Webpack
-Generating script & css references inside index.html via webpack
